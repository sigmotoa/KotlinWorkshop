# Authentication

# Password method 1: Add the password to the system keyring, and let msmtp get
# it automatically. To set the keyring password using libsecret:
# $ secret-tool store --label=msmtp \
#   host smtp.freemail.example \
#   service smtp \
#   user joe.smith
# Password method 2: Store the password in an encrypted file, and tell msmtp
# which command to use to decrypt it. This is usually used with GnuPG, as in
# this example. Usually gpg-agent will ask once for the decryption password.
passwordeval gpg2 --no-tty -q -d ~/.msmtp-password.gpg
# You can also store the password directly in this file or have msmtp ask you
# for it each time you send a mail, but one of the above methods is preferred.

# A second mail address at the same freemail service: it uses the same settings
# and just changes the envelope from address

#account company
#host mail.company.example
#from smithjoe@company.example
#auth on
#user company12345
# this assumes the password is stored in the keyring
